NAME
    Net::Protocol::Simple - Perl extension for handling simple generic
    protocol layers within applications

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Protocol::Simple;
      my $p = Net::Protocol::Simple->new(protocol => 6, layer => 4);

      $p->protocol(); Gives us 'TCP'
      $p->int(); Gives us 6;

      my $p = Net::Protocol::Simple->new(protocol = 'udp', layer => 4);
      $p->protocol(); Gives us 'UDP';
      $p->int(); Gives us 17;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to be used in conjunction with
    Net::Connection::Simple. Some applications such as snort and other IDS's
    log their alert data as simple connections. This module will allow you
    to read in their protocol data as an int or a string. The backend stores
    it as a string (TCP,UDP,ICMP). Natively it will handle these three
    protocols, but it will scale to any other layer and protocol as a simple
    handler. Using Net::Connection::Simple, you can use these to populate
    the multiple layers of the connection.
